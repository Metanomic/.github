## The Metanomic Product

Metanomic helps virtual-world creators make smarter decisions from the evolving stories that data tells about what keeps people engaged in their Metaverse.

By combining Engine's ability to manage economic instances with Thunderstruck's ability to turn those economic instances into actionable insights, which can in turn be used to further optimise economic instances to maximise player retention and engagement in terms of both time and money spent in play and platform, we can help game developers to design and run more fun, and more profitable metaverse expenses to convert intrinsic value into shared extrinsic value and virtuous cycles for all parties.

## Our AI Platform (Thunderstruck)

Thunderstruck is a data and player classification and categorisation tool for any game, platform, or digital environment. Thunderstruck helps you to understand and segment players better, enhance LiveOps, increase ad monetisation, and make more informed decisions around your users.

With Thunderstruck API, you can send your first-party in-gaming data, as events as they happen within the virtual world. “Virtual World” is Metanomic’s generic word for any digital application, game or metaverse you own, on any kind of a platform; website, mobile app, and processes that run on a server or OTT device.

When Thunderstruck generates the category insights, based on your interaction data, you can send it (often in real-time) to your marketing, product, and analytics (BI) tools, as well as to data warehouses.
