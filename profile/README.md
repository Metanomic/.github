# Welcome to Metanomic

## The Metanomic Product

Metanomic helps virtual-world creators make smarter decisions from the evolving stories that data tells about what keeps people engaged in their Metaverse.

By combining Engine's ability to manage economic instances with Thunderstruck's ability to turn those economic instances into actionable insights, which can in turn be used to further optimise economic instances to maximise player retention and engagement in terms of both time and money spent in play and platform, we can help game developers to design and run more fun, and more profitable metaverse expenses to convert intrinsic value into shared extrinsic value and virtuous cycles for all parties.
